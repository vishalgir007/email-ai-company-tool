## üîÑ Practice Questions & Answers

### Q: "How does your web scraping work without APIs?"
**A:** "I scrape DuckDuckGo's HTML search results using Python's Requests library and BeautifulSoup for parsing. I use multiple search queries, rotate user agents, and implement rate limiting to mimic natural browsing behavior while respecting the website's terms of service."

### Q: "What happens if web scraping fails?"
**A:** "I have multiple fallback layers: if one search engine fails, I try different endpoints; if all web searches fail, I use domain intelligence to generate smart company names; and I have a comprehensive keyword database for sector classification as a final fallback."

### Q: "How do you ensure 100% success rate?"
**A:** "The three-layer architecture guarantees results: local database for known companies, aggressive web search with 14 query patterns for unknowns, and intelligent fallbacks that generate meaningful company names and sectors from domain patterns. Every email address will produce a result."
