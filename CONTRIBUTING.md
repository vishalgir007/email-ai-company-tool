# Contributing to Email AI Company Tool

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Email AI Company Tool! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## ü§ù How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, please create an issue with:
- **Clear title** describing the problem
- **Steps to reproduce** the issue
- **Expected behavior** vs actual behavior
- **Environment details** (Python version, OS, etc.)
- **Log files** or error messages if available

### Suggesting Features

We welcome feature suggestions! Please:
- Check existing issues to avoid duplicates
- Provide clear use cases for the feature
- Explain how it benefits users
- Consider implementation complexity

### Code Contributions

1. **Fork the repository**
2. **Create a feature branch**: `git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`
3. **Make your changes** following our coding standards
4. **Add tests** for new functionality
5. **Update documentation** as needed
6. **Commit changes**: `git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`
7. **Push to branch**: `git push origin feature/amazing-feature`
8. **Open a Pull Request**

## üìù Coding Standards

### Python Style
- Follow **PEP 8** guidelines
- Use **type hints** for function parameters and returns
- Include **docstrings** for all functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and under 50 lines when possible

### Code Examples

**Good:**
```python
def extract_company_name(domain: str) -> Optional[str]:
    """
    Extract company name from domain using fuzzy matching.
    
    Args:
        domain: The domain to analyze (e.g., 'google.com')
        
    Returns:
        Company name if found, None otherwise
    """
    if not domain or '.' not in domain:
        return None
    
    # Implementation here
    return company_name
```

**Bad:**
```python
def extract(d):  # No type hints, unclear name
    # No docstring
    if d:
        # Complex logic without explanation
        return something
```

### Testing
- Write tests for new functions
- Maintain test coverage above 80%
- Use meaningful test names: `test_extract_company_name_with_valid_domain`

### Documentation
- Update README.md for new features
- Add docstrings to all public functions
- Include code examples where helpful

## üß™ Development Setup

1. **Clone your fork**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/email-ai-company-tool.git
   cd email-ai-company-tool
   ```

2. **Create virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt  # Development dependencies
   ```

4. **Run tests**:
   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

- `documentation`: Improvements to documentation
- `good first issue`: Good for newcomers
- `help wanted`: Extra attention needed
- `priority-high`: Important issues
- `priority-low`: Nice-to-have features

## üì¶ Release Process

### Version Numbers
We follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):
- **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH** (e.g., 2.1.3)

## üéØ Project Roadmap

### Current Focus
- Performance optimization
- Enhanced error handling
- Better test coverage
- Documentation improvements

### Future Plans
- Machine learning integration

## üí° Development Guidelines

### Architecture Principles
1. **Modularity**: Keep components separate and focused
2. **Scalability**: Design for large datasets
3. **Reliability**: Handle errors gracefully
4. **Performance**: Optimize for speed and memory
5. **Maintainability**: Write clean, documented code

### Best Practices
- Use meaningful variable names
- Keep functions small and focused
- Handle edge cases and errors
- Write self-documenting code
- Use consistent naming conventions

### Performance Considerations
- Cache results to avoid redundant operations
- Use async operations for I/O bound tasks
- Optimize database queries
- Monitor memory usage for large files
- Implement rate limiting for web requests
